- What's up, I'm Bodie and I'm a CS student at South Dakota State University
- I'm a major switch student, with a lot of Ag Ed previous experience. I have minors in Animal Science and am working on one in Data Science as well
- In free time I enjoy playing video games, swimming open water races, or riding my longboard.
