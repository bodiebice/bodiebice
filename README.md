# I'm Bodie

I'm a aspiring software engineer from Waseca, Minnesota currently enrolled at Minnesota State University, Mankato. I'm passionate about learning new things, and I have found that my favorite languages so far are C++ and Python. 

I am constantly working on improving, both through work with professional opportunites through my unique project work at my university, or through personal learnings and projects.

Outside of school, I enjoy time with friends and family, working on the farm when time allows, and playing CCGs and Video Games on the weekends.

Feel free to reach out over email, or, some even better ways to find me is at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bodie-bice-5a25a9196/) or through a DM on Discord. My Discord @ is Nitang
